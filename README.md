This is a comparison between Breadth First Search and Prim's Algorithm to find a minimum spanning tree for a weighted graph.

The experiment runs each algorithm on a set of random graphs. An analysis of the results can be found in the analysis file.

This was an assignment for the Data Structures course at Queen's University
